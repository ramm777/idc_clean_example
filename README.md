# idc_clean_example
A simulator or a computational method for the solid and fluid mechanics modelling in fractures. 

This is a clean example of the solid and fluid mechanics simulator to model fracture compaction with permeability calculation at each simulation step. The simulator is called Interacting Discrete Contunua and Stokes (IDC+S) and uses Virtual Element Method and Finite Volume Method. 

The main file to run is compaction.m using MATLAB programming language. However, to run the file, you need to download The MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST). This module needs to be placed in the vemmech module, or lacking modules can be redirected by updating the path. 

Numerical grid can be selected from a lot of pre-defined grids using the natural Camel mudrock. Usually hard-coded grids are used in this module.
